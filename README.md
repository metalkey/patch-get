# patch-get
Microsoft patchlist optimiser<br>
1. Organise a list of MS patches you need to install into a single file (patchlist.txt).<br>
2. Run ./patch-get.sh to retrieve all MS pages relating to each patch in the patchlist.txt<br>
3. Run ./extract.sh to view a list of all superceded/obsolete patches that you do not need to install.<br>
Optionally: You can diff both files to get a list of all of the patches you need to install.<br>
